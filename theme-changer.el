;;; Commentary:

;; Given a location and day/night color themes, this file provides a
;; `change-theme` function that selects the appropriate theme based on
;; whether it is day or night. It will continue to change themes at
;; sunrise and sunset. To install:

;; Set the location:
;;     (setq calendar-location-name "Dallas, TX") 
;;     (setq calendar-latitude 32.85)
;;     (setq calendar-longitude -96.85)

;; Specify the day and night themes:
;;     (require 'theme-changer)
;;     (change-theme 'solarized-light 'solarized-dark)

;; One can also pass nil as either of parameters to change-theme, with the
;; effect of not using a theme (or using the default Emacs them) during that
;; period of the day. For example:

;;     (change-theme nil 'solarized-dark)

;; shall result in setting the default Emacs theme during the day, and
;; solarized-dark during the night.

;; You may need to add this file path to your loadpath. For example:
;;     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elisp/theme-changer")

;; If you want to use the color-theme package instead of the Emacs 24 color
;; theme facility:
;;     (setq theme-changer-mode "color-theme")
;;     (change-theme 'color-theme-solarized-light 'color-theme-solarized-dark)
